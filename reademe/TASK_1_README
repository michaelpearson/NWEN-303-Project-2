The echo client and server have been changed to check for the new knock knock joke.
The server simply waits for a connection, once connected it waits for the message "knock knock"
The client sends the line "Knock, knock" which the server then responds to. This goes until the client is finished and disconnects.

The Search program was modified to take another parameter. The parameter is a long integer which specifies how many
iterations of the loop should be run. Each iteration of the loop the key is incremented by one, so the number of
 iterations is equal to the search size.
